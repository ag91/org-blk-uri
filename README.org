This module provides a way to extract file or web content into a Org
Mode source block.

An example of use is when you want to archive the version of a web
page for your own record (e.g., a job ad you applied for and that gets
taken down from the Internet).

Thanks to SÅ‚awomir who asked me to publish this during one of our
EmacsBuddy interactions: it would have probably staid in my private
configuration otherwise.
